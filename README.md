### Notes on Election Results <a name="election_results"></a>

In the case of a PAST election, the election result will be in the candidate object returned above as the `election_result` object. It can take one of three values (LOSE, WIN, RUNOFF, PRIMARY WIN).  Below is an example of a snippet of the candidate response with an election result in it.

```
          "first_name": "Clare",
          "last_name": "Quish",
          "election_result": "WON",
          "suffix": "",
          "incumbent": false,
          "position_id": 78977,
          "election_id": 5,
          "election_day": "2018-03-20",
```

The best way to make sure you get only the values for the election you want is to query on the `election_date` parameter. Once the election passes, we'll being updating the `election_result` flags.

Election results can mean different things for different types of primary election races. If the position is Louisiana style (`la_style: true`), then the position can be won outright in the primary. In a normal primary election (`la_style: false`), this is not the case.

In a normal (`la_style: false`) primary election:

RUNOFF means the candidate is advancing to a primary runoff.
PRIMARY WIN means the candidate won the primary and is moving on to the general election.

In a Louisiana Style (`la_style: true`) primary election:

WON means the candidate won outright.
RUNOFF means the candidate is advancing to the runoff/general election.


## Candidates API <a name="candidates_api"></a>
**Parameters:**

    "name": string
  },
]
```

**Parameters:**
* address - Address (Required, OR lat/lng is required)
